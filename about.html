      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Community Voice</strong> — a platform built to empower citizens to raise local concerns like broken electric poles, damaged roads, garbage dumps, and other civic issues in their neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that it’s not always clear who to contact when something goes wrong in your locality. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the people who see the problems every day and the service providers who can solve them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through our platform, anyone can report a problem in just a few clicks. These reports are visible to the public and also to municipal workers, contractors, or volunteers who can act on them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, we aim to build cleaner, safer, and more responsive neighborhoods — one report at a time. Your voice matters. Let’s make it heard.
